# The Prism



> Where complexity is like white light, and true knowledge is the spectrum. The Prism helps you analyze the inner dimensions of a complex world.



## 🌟 Project Philosophy



In the age of information explosion, we are surrounded by a sea of news, opinions, and data every day. How can we find the truth amidst this complex information? How can we cultivate critical thinking and avoid being misled?

**The Prism** is an intelligent analysis tool designed specifically for critical thinking. Just as a physical prism can break white light into a colorful spectrum, our application can break down complex events, news, or opinions into four core dimensions:

- 🔍 **Source Analysis** - Investigating the reliability and background of the information source.
- 📊 **Evidence Evaluation** - Assessing the solidity and objectivity of the factual basis.
- 🧠 **Logical Reasoning** - Analyzing the rigor of the argumentation structure and identifying logical fallacies.
- 🌐 **Contextual Understanding** - Comprehending the historical background and a diversity of perspectives.
